Hey! Utsav here.

I'm a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon pursuing a major in Artificial Intelligence.
I had completed my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Madras.

My interests lie in machine learning and NLP.
I am fascinated by the application of statistical methods in healthcare, engineering systems and medicine.

Have a look at my personal website to learn more about me: https://utsavdutta98.github.io/utsavdutta.github.io/
Would love to connect over LinkedIn or at utsavdutta98[at]gmail.com
